    "text": "Oden Ranch\n\n\n\n\n\n📷: John T. Foster\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOden Ranch is a nearly 800 acre ranch located in the Texas Hill Country, 8 miles east of Marble Falls, TX. Because of the 66 mile long Lake Travis in the way, it would take about 1.5 hours to drive there from campus. My home is located 2/3 along the way so it was easy for me to frequent the ranch, and I would go there usually about once a month or two to help filling deer feeders and assisting in other ranch maintence duties. Other frequent visitors were Jon Bass, Fanis Stroubalous, and Tinsely’s son-in-law Nick. The ranch had about 10 miles of roads encircling and criss-crossing steep densly wooded hills, dotted with small meadows. This inlcudes the largest “mountain” in the vicinity, “Blue Mountain”. There were 7 deer feeders and cooresponding hunting blinds located around the ranch. The principal duty of my visits were to fill the deer feeders. Tinsley’s life-long dedication to the gym paid off because a year before he passed, and before his cancer had been diagnosed, at the age of 85, he could pick up a 50 lb bag of corn and carrying it 15 yards accros sometimes rocky ground and hand it to me standing near the top of a ladder to fill the feeders."

Tinsley Oden\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMost of what was “ranched” at Oden Ranch, but not in an animal husbandry sense, but through care and preservation of habitat was the wildlife. The ranch had many Texas natives: whitetail deer being the primary hunted game, but also predeators such as bobcat and mountain lion. Tinsley told me a story once that while drivng the property, he came across a fresh cougar kill. A nice whitetail buck. He returned to the barn to retrive a saw, in order to go back and saw the antlers off the dead deer, only to return to find the deer gone. Having been dragged into the brush… That could only mean the predator was likely watching from a nearby tree when Tinsley first discovered the deer. The ranch also unfornately has many invasive “wild boars” which he and Texas wildlife bioligst despised because they compete with deer for food and destroy habitat. Tinsley was very excited to discover a non-native European red deer on the property. As well as, technically native, but long exterpated and reintroduced elk.\nThis photos came from game cameras that are motion activated and located near some of the feeders on the property. He loved to look at, and share with me interesting sightings from these cameras.\nHe could name most of the native plant species around the ranch. Among his favorite was the rare “Texas Maduro” which has a beatiful red colored, barkless trunk and branches. He was particularly good at identifying water-fowl perhaps from his growing up in central Lousianan. Although he hated cormorants for some reason…"

While some folks see taxidermy as a distastful celebration over the death of an animal. While I personally don’t have any taxidermy in my home most hunters, and Tinsley was no different, see the taxidermy as way to remember the adventure. He could tell you detailed stories about how every animal was harvested. The location, the weather, the hunting partners who adventured with him. Jon Bass got to go on several of these adventures. In reading his self-published, “Diary of a Tanzanian Safari,” I found the stoies of the people he was with just as intersting as the details of the hunt. I still recall how he developed a personal friendship with Paul, the African Profesional Hunter (i.e. guide) that accompanied him on that trip."

Foster\n\n\n\n\nWhile I am a lifelong hunter and angler, most of my experience in the outdoors was limited to Texas where I grew up. Tinsely inspired me to begin my own expedition hunting adventures. I have been able to go on week long hunting adventures every year since 2018, including my own “tack on” hunt after giving a keynote talk at Africomp in Cape Town in 2023. I enjoyed sharing these adventures with Tinsley and he was always eager to here the outcome.\nThese are photos from a long-planned hunt I was on this last year during Tinsley’s memorial service, the reason for my absense. I wrote Barbara and Lee (Tinsley’s wife and daughter) and explained why I would not be in attendance, but that I was dedicating the hunt to my late friend. We were sucessful, harvesting a mule deer with a bow and arrow at 12,500 feet in the mountains above Lake City, CO. We butchered the animal on the mountain side and carried out all the meat along with our gear on our backs and off the mountain. Some of the backstrap (the loin, one of the most prized cuts of meat on a deer) was given to Barbara and Lee in memory of Tin, the rest has been feeding my family."

    "text": "📷: John T. Foster\nOne morning after filling feeders, we were sitting at this table at Blue Bonnet Cafe.\nIntroduce people seated\nThe topic of conversation turned to poetry. I asked if Tin had written any lately, he replied “Nothing you’d want to hear”. Callie then asked, “Do you have a favorite poem?” Tin’s reply, “Little Boy Blue by Eugene Field”. He went on to explain that it was his mothers favorite poem. When she was ederly, Tin and Barbara remodeled thier in the NW Hills of Austin to add a garage apartment for her to live. He said every night, he would go into her room and read peotry to her. Frequently, Little Boy Blue. Her name was Sara. Callie then asked, “Do you remember it?”. Tin, “Do you want to hear it?” Then Tinsley began to recite the poem while looking directly at Callie. I can’t explain it, but there was a feeling as if he was once again reciting the poem to his mother. His eyes filled with tears. So did Callie’s. Jon Bass, who’s mother had recently passed, began to tear up as well. My own eyes followed. It was one of the most memorable moments of my life. So with that, I’d like to end my talk by reading “Little Boy Blue”."
