# The Rancher 

::: {.notes}

I'd like thank the organisers for allowing me to present a non-technical talk in this session.  This is my first time doing so and strangly I'm more nervous than when giving technical talks.  Everyone in this room is aware of Tinsely's academic accomplishments and overall impact on the field of computational mechanics.  I'd like to share some personal stories from our friendship.

Tinsley's work ethic was well known.  You could almost set your watch according to his schedule.  He usually arrived at campus around 7:30 AM every weekday morning.  He would go to gym Sunday-Thursday around 4:30 PM (Leszeck in tow), spending many Sunday evenings on campus after the gym.  He wore a suit Monday-Thursday.  But Friday's he wore jeans and cowboy boots because come 4:30, he was heading the Ranch.  He would stay there until dark on Saturday, or during deer season, he would sometimes stay to hunt Sunday morning as well.

Oden Ranch is a nearly 800 acre ranch located in the Texas Hill Country, 8 miles east of Marble Falls, TX.  Because of the 66 mile long Lake Travis in the way, it would take about 1.5 hours to drive there from campus.  My home is located 2/3 along the way so it was easy for me to frequent the ranch, and I would go there usually about once a month or two to help filling deer feeders and assisting in other ranch maintence duties. Other frequent visitors were Jon Bass, Fanis Stroubalous, and Tinsely's son-in-law Nick.  The ranch had about 10 miles of roads encircling and criss-crossing steep densly wooded hills, dotted with small meadows.  This inlcudes the largest "mountain" in the vicinity, "Blue Mountain".  There were 7 deer feeders and cooresponding hunting blinds located around the ranch.  The principal duty of my visits were to fill the deer feeders.  Tinsley's life-long dedication to the gym paid off because a year before he passed, and before his cancer had been diagnosed, at the age of 85, he could pick up a 50 lb bag of corn and carrying it 15 yards accros sometimes rocky ground and hand it to me standing near the top of a ladder to fill the feeders.

::: {.notes}
Most folks associate ranching with cattle, especially in Texas.  While I know that Tinsley had leased out the ranch to for cattle grazing at some point in the past, during my time at the ranch, from 2014 on there were never any cattle there.  Or at least they weren't supposed to be.  Tinsley's friend Eugene Bible, who would also mow parts of the ranch and maintain the roads, had cattle on his neighboring property.  One day, while filling feeders, we were driving along a road that was set against a barded-wire fence separating Tinsley and Eugenes ranches.  There, in the middle of the road, on our side of the fence, was a cow and a calf.  That is, they were loose, likely Eugenes.  We were worried that they would disappear into the interior of the ranch and would be difficult to locate.  The first move was to call Eugene -- no answer.  Next, while still sitting in the truck, we tried to located and downed or broken fence line to try to figure out how they had gotten on to the ranch.  There was no obvious answer.  There was a small gap in a panel of fence that was installed underneath the lowest strand of barbed wire where a small drainage or dry-creek crossed the road, and we could see a small gap that it was possible the calf came thru, but far two small for the 1000 lb cow to make it.  I decided to removing some bailing wire holding that panel in place and hold that section of fence open, while Tinsley tried to guide the cow and calf in that direction.  We go the calf to pass through, but the cow wasn't interest.  However, once her calf was on the other side of the fence, she got highly agitated and ran through some brush and around the truck which was fulling blocking the road between the fence and the brush.  Once on the other side of the truck, the cow turned to face the fence, it's nose near the top strand of barbed wire.  The huge cow then, from a flat-footed stance, leaped over the fence, completely clearing it much like a deer would, landing safely on the side with the calf.  Tinsley and I stared at other with mutual grins in disbelief to what we witnessed.  He then says, "I guess we know how she got over to this side of the fence."

Pictured on the left is Tinsley in his trademark ranch atire talking to Jon Bass.  The picture on the left was taken by me, from Blue Mountain, and much of what you see in the background is Oden Ranch.  Take note of the lake in the background.  It's an 8-acre lake on the ranch.  I'll have more to say about the lake momentarily.

Most of what was "ranched" at Oden Ranch, but not in an animal husbandry sense, but through care and preservation of habitat was the wildlife.  The ranch had many Texas natives: whitetail deer being the primary hunted game, but also predeators such as bobcat and mountain lion.  Tinsley told me a story once that while drivng the property, he came across a fresh cougar kill.  A nice whitetail buck.  He returned to the barn to retrive a saw, in order to go back and saw the antlers off the dead deer, only to return to find the deer gone.  Having been dragged into the brush...  That could only mean the predator was likely watching from a nearby tree when Tinsley first discovered the deer.  The ranch also unfornately has many invasive "wild boars" which he and Texas wildlife bioligst despised because they compete with deer for food and destroy habitat.  Tinsley was very excited to discover a non-native European red deer on the property.  As well as, technically native, but long exterpated and reintroduced elk.

This photos came from game cameras that are motion activated and located near some of the feeders on the property.  He loved to look at, and share with me interesting sightings from these cameras.

He could name most of the native plant species around the ranch.  Among his favorite was the rare "Texas Maduro" which has a beatiful red colored, barkless trunk and branches.  He was particularly good at identifying water-fowl perhaps from his growing up in central Lousianan.  Although he hated cormorants for some reason...

Rememer the lake?  This is a picture of what Tinsley told me was the largest bass every caught in the lake.  It was caught by my son in April 2018 at the then ICES, now Oden Institute, Picnic.  The picture was taken by Chad Landis, who many of you know, and who was with us at the time.

# The Hunter

::: {.notes}
Tinsley was a proud and accomplished hunter.  He respected other hunters and outdoorsman.  He understood that we are all here today becase our ancestors were hunters.  He particularly admired native Americans hunters.  One of his favorite books, which he gifted a copy to me and several others, was "Empire of the Summer Moon" which documents the history of the greatest and most feared plains Indians horseman, The Commanche.

He went on expedition hunts for caribu in the Northern Territories of Canada, hunted Brown bear on Kodiak Island Alaska, elk, mule deer, and antelope in the Rocky Mountain Western United States, puma in Argentina, and plains game and predetors in Africa.  Often, he would use the ocassion of an invited talk to "tack on" a hunt.  The meat from animals harvested was always cared for, never wasted.  While I never got to experience it my self, he told me that Barbara was an excellent venison chef.

Several of his taxidermidied animals were on display at the ranch house.  While some folks see taxidermy as a distastful celebration over the death of an animal.  While I personally don't have any taxidermy in my home most hunters, and Tinsley was no different, see the taxidermy as way to remember the adventure.  He could tell you detailed stories about how every animal was harvested.  The location, the weather, the hunting partners who adventured with him.  Jon Bass got to go on several of these adventures.  In reading his self-published, "Diary of a Tanzanian Safari," I found the stoies of the people he was with just as intersting as the details of the hunt.  I still recall how he developed a personal friendship with Paul, the African Profesional Hunter (i.e. guide) that accompanied him on that trip.

Tinsely was a great mentor to many young and first time hunters.  Often inviting postdocs, graduate students, and visitors who were interested out to the ranch.  My son (pictured) harvested a "wild boar" and a turkey on on memorable Spring day.

While I am a lifelong hunter and angler, most of my experience in the outdoors was limited to Texas where I grew up.  Tinsely inspired me to begin my own expedition hunting adventures.  I have been able to go on week long hunting adventures every year since 2018, including my own "tack on" hunt after giving a keynote talk at Africomp in Cape Town in 2023.  I enjoyed sharing these adventures with Tinsley and he was always eager to here the outcome.  

These are photos from a long-planned hunt I was on this last year during Tinsley's memorial service, the reason for my absense.  I wrote Barbara and Lee (Tinsley's wife and daughter) and explained why I would not be in attendance, but that I was dedicating the hunt to my late friend.  We were sucessful, harvesting a mule deer with a bow and arrow at 12,500 feet in the mountains above Lake City, CO.  We butchered the animal on the mountain side and carried out all the meat along with our gear on our backs and off the mountain.  Some of the backstrap (the loin, one of the most prized cuts of meat on a deer) was given to Barbara and Lee in memory of Tin, the rest has been feeding my family.

No hunting or work day at Oden Ranch was complete without a late morning breakfast at Blue Bonnet Cafe.  A traditional small town diner that has been open continuously since 1929.  They have "Pie Happy Hour" everyday from 3-5 PM.  I've often wondered if in thier 95 years of existance if anyone has spent more money there than him?  Nearly every Saturday for 40 years he was there.

One morning after filling feeders, we were sitting at this table at Blue Bonnet Cafe.

**Introduce people seated**

The topic of conversation turned to poetry.  I asked if Tin had written any lately, he replied "Nothing you'd want to hear".  Callie then asked, "Do you have a favorite poem?"  Tin's reply, "Little Boy Blue by Eugene Field".  He went on to explain that it was his mothers favorite poem.  When she was ederly, Tin and Barbara remodeled thier in the NW Hills of Austin to add a garage apartment for her to live.  He said every night, he would go into her room and read peotry to her.  Frequently, Little Boy Blue.  Her name was Sara.  Callie then asked, "Do you remember it?".  Tin, "Do you want to hear it?"  Then Tinsley began to recite the poem while looking directly at Callie.  I can't explain it, but there was a feeling as if he was once again reciting the poem to his mother.  His eyes filled with tears.  So did Callie's.  Jon Bass, who's mother had recently passed, began to tear up as well.  My own eyes followed.  It was one of the most memorable moments of my life.  So with that, I'd like to end my talk by reading "Little Boy Blue".

## Little Boy Blue {.scrollable .smaller}
### Eugene Field 

::: {.fragment}

>The little toy dog is covered with dust,  
$\quad$ But sturdy and staunch he stands;  
And the little toy soldier is red with rust,  
$\quad$ And his musket molds in his hands.  
Time was when the little toy dog was new,  
$\quad$ And the soldier was passing fair;  
And that was the time when our Little Boy Blue  
$\quad$ Kissed them and put them there.  
<br>
"Now, don't you go till I come," he said,  
$\quad$ "And don't you make any noise!"  
So, toddling off to his trundle-bed,  
$\quad$ He dreamed of the pretty toys;  
And, as he was dreaming, an angel song  
$\quad$ Awakened our Little Body Blue  
Oh! the years are many, the years are long,  
$\quad$ But the little toy friends are true!  
<br>
Ay, faithful to Little Boy Blue they stand,  
$\quad$ Each in the same old place  
Awaiting the touch of a little hand,  
$\quad$ The smile of a little face;  
And they wonder, as waiting the long years through  
$\quad$ In the dust of that little chair,  
What has become of our Little Boy Blue,  
$\quad$ Since he kissed them and put them there.
