## Little Boy Blue {.scrollable .smaller}
### Eugene Field 

::: {.fragment}

>The little toy dog is covered with dust,  
$\quad$ But sturdy and staunch he stands;  
And the little toy soldier is red with rust,  
$\quad$ And his musket molds in his hands.  
Time was when the little toy dog was new,  
$\quad$ And the soldier was passing fair;  
And that was the time when our Little Boy Blue  
$\quad$ Kissed them and put them there.  
<br>
"Now, don't you go till I come," he said,  
$\quad$ "And don't you make any noise!"  
So, toddling off to his trundle-bed,  
$\quad$ He dreamed of the pretty toys;  
And, as he was dreaming, an angel song  
$\quad$ Awakened our Little Body Blue  
Oh! the years are many, the years are long,  
$\quad$ But the little toy friends are true!  
<br>
Ay, faithful to Little Boy Blue they stand,  
$\quad$ Each in the same old place  
Awaiting the touch of a little hand,  
$\quad$ The smile of a little face;  
And they wonder, as waiting the long years through  
$\quad$ In the dust of that little chair,  
What has become of our Little Boy Blue,  
$\quad$ Since he kissed them and put them there.
